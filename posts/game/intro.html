<p style="margin-top: 1em">I Play Video Games.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">This isn&rsquo;t really anything
special these days, but I figure that at this point
I&rsquo;ve probably played enough video games to have some
meaningful comments on them from time to time. This section
will be where I talk about games, gaming, what I&rsquo;m
playing, the state of the industry, so on and so forth.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">While not a terribly unique
position, I&rsquo;ve been playing games most of my life,
starting on PC and on the original Nintendo (some of you
probably know it best as the NES). While these days all my
PC gaming is on Linux, I have four of the five Playstations,
an Xbox One X, a Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, and a FireCore
Genesis. This, in my opinion, gives me a wide base of gaming
experience to draw upon. As someone technical, I believe I
also have a basic understanding of how each of these
consoles work, as well as their strengths and
weaknesses.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">So if any of this sounds
interesting, please stay tuned! Hopefully this section will
prove entertaining and informative to you.</p>
