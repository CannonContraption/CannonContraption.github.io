<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is becoming less and less
unusual as time goes on, but I&rsquo;m a big fan of
well-built keyboards. Many people call these
&quot;mechanical&quot;, though that descriptor is a very
loaded term, in my opinion. My experience with keyboards
isn&rsquo;t nearly as broad as with video games, but I feel
I have some interesting opinions to share on the topic, so I
may as well write about it.</p>

<h2>2. What Makes a Keyboard Good?
<a name="2. What Makes a Keyboard Good?"></a>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Good keyboards have a number of
advantages, but most of them are pretty subjective.
Different types of boards, layouts, interfaces, switch
mechanisms, and a variety of other factors determine what
makes a good keyboard.</p>

<h3>2.1. Board Type
<a name="2.1. Board Type"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting with some of the less
significant factors, there&rsquo;s the type of board. This
includes the body, mounting plate, and physical structure of
the case. Some boards have the switches entirely exposed,
with the switches protruding from an exposed plate, some use
a surround to recess the keys, making the unit feel a little
bit more integrated. Generally this doesn&rsquo;t have a ton
of bearing on how the board is perceived, but something
really cheaply made will make the rest of the board feel
cheap. Rigid materials are usually preferred.</p>

<h3>2.2. Layouts
<a name="2.2. Layouts"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is probably the most
subjective part of this entire post. I&rsquo;m not going to
make calls about what is better, but I&rsquo;ll briefly
touch on my own preferences at the end.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Starting from the most obvious,
there&rsquo;s physical board layouts. The standard variety
that most PC users are accustomed to is the 104-key PC
layout. Even if you use a Mac, the basic layout of your
keyboard mirrors the 104-key standard with only minor
modifications. However, there are also 10-keyless, which are
the same without the number pad, navless, which have no
navigation cluster, 60%, which leave out the function row,
nav cluster, and number pad, split ergonomic keyboards,
which separate the hands by some amount of space, 75%, which
rearranged the nav cluster to fit on the side of the board,
and leaves out the number pad, and many more. These are just
some of the most common ones. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll
probably go into a lot more detail on this later, so if you
see me referring to some specific layout, if I don&rsquo;t
describe it you should look to other sources to find out
what they are. Chances are good, however, that I&rsquo;ll
just describe what I mean.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Less common is alphanumeric
arrangement changes. Most people who know much about
keyboards probably know what the Dvorak layout is, at a
minimum. Boards with this layout are generally fairly
available, as are replacement keycaps for retrofitting a
board with Dvorak legends. In my case, I use regular QWERTY
boards, remapped in software to use the Workman layout. I
think this brings a good balance of efficiency and comfort
improvements over QWERTY without requiring as much
retraining as Dvorak, or completely new hardware. I have a
toggle to go back to QWERTY for in case I need to hand off
my computer to someone else for a moment.</p>

<h3>2.3. Interfaces
<a name="2.3. Interfaces"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">Everyone uses USB these days,
but PS/2 is still common. There are specific reasons why
someone would opt for one interface or another, but
that&rsquo;s usually for compatibility with exotic hardware.
There are some theoretical advantages to PS/2, but I have
yet to see any tangible benefit of it on modern systems.</p>

<h3>2.4. Switches
<a name="2.4. Switches"></a>
</h3>


<p style="margin-top: 1em">This is where I&rsquo;ll
probably spend the most time. This part is the part that
most affects the feel of a keyboard. Most common is of
course the rubber dome switch. If you own a laptop, if it
uses scissor or butterfly switches, these are just
stabilizing mechanisms for rubber domes. Next most common
would be Cherry MX switches. There are others, but this is
really where the bulk of the market is. These generally
mount to the board in the same way as each other, but they
don&rsquo;t always share quite the same mechanism. In terms
of cross-compatibility, the broadest market for boards,
switches, and keycaps is the Cherry MX world. Rubber dome
boards are usually made to be cheap to manufacture first,
and therefore each board comes with its own designs to mount
keycaps and stabilize keys.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 1em">Right now, I&rsquo;m writing
this article using Kaihua Kailh Box White switches, which I
expect I&rsquo;ll be reviewing at some point.</p>
