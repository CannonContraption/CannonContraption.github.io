&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;The Ratchet and Clank series has
been getting a lot of buzz lately, what with the trailers
for the new PS5 entry, Rift Apart. However, the series got
its start way back in 2002 on the PS2, as Insomniac
Games&amp;rsquo; first entry on the platform. This particular
series is, in my opinion, the single best 3D platforming
series ever released, and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m
alone in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1.1. Personally
&lt;a name="1.1. Personally"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;I got my start with the series
on the PS3. Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time was
the second game I ever played on PS3, behind the original
Little Big Planet. Having grown up mostly with the Nintendo
Entertainment System and a relatively weak
&amp;quot;multimedia&amp;quot; PC, the experience was mind-blowing
to me. Watching what was essentially a computer game render
visuals with particle effects everywhere, a 3D world I could
run around in, the massive number of things on screen, it
captivated me. As if the visuals weren&amp;rsquo;t enough, the
sound design and soundtrack in that game are among the best
ever made, certainly up to that point, but even now the
experience still holds up remarkably well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;My first interaction with the
first game, however, was much later on. The first time I
played it was in the Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank Collection, on PS3.
The graphics and sound were of course much more primitive
than the technical showpieces that are the PS3 entries I had
played up to that point, but nevertheless it felt like much
the same game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;1.2. Game Basics
&lt;a name="1.2. Game Basics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Core to the Ratchet and Clank
series is the usual 3D-platforming challenges, a diverse set
of enemies with different attack styles, and an enormous
arsenal of weaponry in various amusing and cartoonish forms.
Interspersed with this are occasional racing or puzzle
sections, that require either quick thinking, mastery of a
DualShock, or careful consideration and planning. Usually
it&amp;rsquo;s a mix of all of this. I believe it&amp;rsquo;s for
reasons of easy adaptability to new concepts and hardware
that Sony chose to make another Ratchet and Clank be one of
the showpieces of PS5 launch marketing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;The focus of Ratchet and Clank
is combat-readiness first, platforming chops second.
You&amp;rsquo;ll need both to a degree, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot
more focus on the gun- and wrench-play than on tricky camera
setups and precise jumps. This, in my opinion, makes it a
lot more approachable to modern (2020) audiences than many
of its contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;2. Controls
&lt;a name="2. Controls"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;So yes, as a warning, you should
have an original controller for whatever PlayStation the
Ratchet and Clank you&amp;rsquo;re interested came out on.
Aftermarket controllers work, but they often make the game
much harder to play. In the case of Ratchet and Clank 1,
that would be a DualShock 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;This, in my opinion, is one of
the great strengths of the game. Most of the series,
possibly all of it, shares this in common- while not every
feature of the console the game launched on is used, the
developers aren&amp;rsquo;t afraid to take advantage of
what&amp;rsquo;s unique and special about that system. In the
case of the PS2 that&amp;rsquo;s the controller, as I mentioned.
However, the game does this without feeling like features
got shoehorned in or slapped on for no reason- if a feature
of a controller is used, for example, it&amp;rsquo;s done
because whatever mechanic uses that feature is uniquely
suited to it. Analog buttons, for example, are used in
swimming in the game. Not only do you have the option of
ascending and descending underwater, but you can control
that by changing the pressure of your finger on the X and
square buttons. A similar story is true for jumping, though
arguably this could be done as well to a reasonable degree
with a digital button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Beyond just the featureset of
the controller, the controls in Ratchet and Clank are...
fine. They work, they don&amp;rsquo;t feel super awkward or
silly, but they&amp;rsquo;re certainly among the roughest in the
series. For example, the lack of a strafe function is
annoying, even though there&amp;rsquo;s a button basically free
for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Where the control set really
seems odd is in its choice to duplicate buttons. Both sets
of shoulder buttons generally do the same thing. So, while
in the PS3 Ratchet and Clank games, you can use R1 to fire
your equipped weapon, R1 is crouch in the original, and so
is R2. There are some minor areas where one set has a
different function from the other, but it&amp;rsquo;s rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;3. Graphics
&lt;a name="3. Graphics"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Ratchet and Clank is...
inoffensive in terms of graphics. It probably won&amp;rsquo;t
blow your mind, even as PS2 games go, but it&amp;rsquo;s also
not hideous. It&amp;rsquo;s stylized enough that the world fits
with itself, the graphics don&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of
this. However, it still retains a lot of flat polygonal
objects, and there are some cut corners when it comes to
things like rounded edges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;As you would expect, the
particle effects are rough and dated, the character models
aren&amp;rsquo;t super detailed, and there&amp;rsquo;s not very much
in the world that could be used to relate scale to the real
world. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the charm of the game in a way,
but if you&amp;rsquo;re not into that sort of thing I could see
the sort of random scale of some objects being an issue. If
you can play Half-Life without any issue, you&amp;rsquo;ll be
fine here, too. However, when put together, what really are
just technical limitations contribute immensely to the style
of the game, making it feel a little bit more like
you&amp;rsquo;re inside a cartoon. The basic particle effects
are maybe the only thing that breaks this a little bit, but
even then it&amp;rsquo;s nothing to really break the experience
overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not to say I
don&amp;rsquo;t enjoy the graphics in this game. I think
what&amp;rsquo;s especially impressive is that they managed to
get long, detailed, winding stages all to fit into memory on
the PS2 without awkward loading screens in the middle of a
planet or a path. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve landed, you aren&amp;rsquo;t
waiting for anything to load off of disk, which contributes
immensely to the feeling of immersion that the game&amp;rsquo;s
world provides. Given that the game was released two years
in to the lifespan of the PS2 (which itself is notoriously
difficult to develop for) and that this is Insomniac&amp;rsquo;s
first PS2 title, what they pulled off with the hardware is
still impressive, despite its shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. Sound
&lt;a name="4. Sound"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.1. Sound Effects
&lt;a name="4.1. Sound Effects"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;This is one area where the
collection falls flat. If you care a lot about audio in your
PS2 games for some reason, play this on the PS2. The PS3
gets the pitch wrong in a bunch of places, which renders
some features of a couple gadgets useless (most affected
being the metal detector).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Sound on the PS2 is fine for a
PS2 game. It won&amp;rsquo;t win any awards, it&amp;rsquo;s dated at
best and has a few harsh sounds that some people will find
annoying, like a lot of (especially older) games, but
it&amp;rsquo;s no so bad as to ruin the experience. Again, it
fits with the style of the game, and where in history it
belongs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Sound effects are generally
basic. There&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot of pitch shifting involved,
which can sometimes make the different sounds sound
interesting, but usually the developers use this for an
over-exaggerated Doppler effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;4.2. Music
&lt;a name="4.2. Music"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;The soundtrack to the original
is very much computer generated. It wears this proudly on
its sleeve, and while it does occasionally try to mimic a
real instrument, it generally doesn&amp;rsquo;t do this in a
totally blatant, tasteless way, and once again the way that
instruments are used contributes somewhat to the aesthetic
of the game. Of course there are ups and downs in this one,
just like any soundtrack, but by the time the game is done
very few of the tracks should have worn out their welcome,
and if one did it won&amp;rsquo;t have probably played for all
that long past that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;However, that&amp;rsquo;s something
I should also put in context. Relative to what most other
soundtracks of the time were like, this one is a great
example of well-composed music matched excellently to each
environment. The music beautifully complements the game
world, both of them feeling dated, but in a pleasant,
nostalgic kind of way for a modern audience, rather than a
tacky, tasteless way. Despite any minor complaints I make
about the soundtrack, I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t switch it for
anything, even at its weakest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;5. Game World
&lt;a name="5. Game World"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5.1. Story
&lt;a name="5.1. Story"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to try my best
not to spoil anything here, but the &amp;quot;Save the solar
system&amp;quot; premise presented within the first 10 minutes
of the game is fairly true to what the game is. It does
require some suspension of disbelief, since the hero of the
story is basically a kid who made a starship using a wiki in
his backyard, not some galactic authority. However,
overlooking this the story is sufficient to keep the game
engaging, and to give some stakes to everything the
character does in that world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;The writing is generally pretty
smart, and while not every joke in the game is going to be
to everyone&amp;rsquo;s taste, the game is overall very
lighthearted, especially considering one of the core tools
the character has is an enormous arsenal of insane weaponry
and various other massive mayhem making mechanisms. In fact,
I would go so far as to say that even given that it was the
original in the series, Ratchet and Clank has some of the
better writing of all of the games in the series. It has its
rough edges, and unfortunately portrays Ratchet as a whiny
teenager, rather than the level-headed awkward fun-guy from
the later games. However, the way this story is told makes
Ratchet and Clank&amp;rsquo;s friendship in the later games make
a lot more sense. In this early game, they start out as
total strangers. Ratchet especially views his relationship
with Clank at first as transactional, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem
to be seeking companionship at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;I want to note briefly here that
in this respect, I think the original game far outpaces the
2016 remake. The new game is good as well, but story-wise
the original introduces the characters and knits them
together in a much more logical way. You know why Ratchet
and Clank stick together, it&amp;rsquo;s not something that just
happens out of nowhere with no explanation or story behind
it other than just pure availability of another character in
the vicinity when robots attack. While we&amp;rsquo;re on the
subject, the tone of the original is, at least in my
opinion, much more suited to the kind of game that any
Ratchet and Clank really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5.2. Environments
&lt;a name="5.2. Environments"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;The different planets the
characters explore, and overall the setting in general is
something that contributes a lot to the game. Starting off
in the middle of nowhere, then proceeding to explore nearly
abandoned spaceships and stations, toxic worlds filled with
poisonous gas, worlds covered in ocean, ice worlds, each
with their own challenges unique to that world adds a great
amount of depth to the game. A lot of the puzzle of the game
is simply figuring out the best way to conquer an
environment. Graphically, most of these areas are fairly
primitive, and some of them feel mechanically similar, but
it almost always feels like there&amp;rsquo;s something unique
about each place. It&amp;rsquo;s also unique to see flying
chainsaws that aren&amp;rsquo;t trying to kill your character,
and find yourself not really questioning it. This may be the
ultimate test of a game world- can you believe it? If not,
do you need to? By the way, I feel I can spoil this much
safely- if you manage to shoot down one of those flying
chainsaws, it gives you a bolt- while not worth much,
it&amp;rsquo;s still kind of fun to see if you can manage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;5.3. Side Missions
&lt;a name="5.3. Side Missions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;On the whole, this is a linear
game. Side missions aren&amp;rsquo;t the focus here at all.
However, there are some alternate paths you can take.
Sometimes these are more obvious than others, but the side
areas and the main quest path feel incredibly similar. This
means that it&amp;rsquo;s easy to choose the wrong one in some
cases, and travel down the side path thinking it was the
story path. Unfortunately for those who like a quick, linear
game, the only way to know that all paths are completed is
to travel through the start menu for a minute and find the
missions page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;There generally aren&amp;rsquo;t
side missions per se, as a result. However, there are
gadgets and items that can be collected by visiting side
paths. They usually come with mission items in the missions
screen marked as just &amp;quot;Explore the Destroyed City&amp;quot;
and things along those lines. If there&amp;rsquo;s something
major to explore (as in not a gold bolt, etc.) then there
will be a mission item for it marked in the missions
page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Each of these side paths result
in a reward of some sort, and the vast majority end up being
well worth it. Unlike future games, for example, gold bolts
are not just used for unlocking cosmetics in-game, but are
instead used to buy gold weapons. This becomes incredibly
useful, especially in late game or in new game+ (which is
NOT challenge mode in this entry).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Overall, my advice in most
Ratchet and Clank games is to follow all of the side paths
completely. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t want the reward at the
end, one of the common tasks in the game is grinding for
bolts. It&amp;rsquo;s not strictly required, you can get by
without doing it, however there&amp;rsquo;s almost always some
weapon or item that would make the game that much more fun
that requires a great sum of bolts (or later other
currencies) to obtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Usually, Ratchet and Clank games
have some specific mini-game challenges, and in this game
that&amp;rsquo;s just hoverboard racing. Everything else is
generally just the usual platforming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;5.3.1. Hoverboard Races
&lt;a name="5.3.1. Hoverboard Races"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;Being perfectly honest,
I&amp;rsquo;m a little bit conflicted about these. The races
control like a kart racer just as much as anything.
There&amp;rsquo;s in-air steering, powerups, accelerator pads,
etc. etc. There&amp;rsquo;s no such thing as a twitch reaction
due to the heavy use of slow tank controls, and
there&amp;rsquo;s a heavy penalty for missing an accelerator
pad, or crashing. Given that both of these are easy to do,
the races certainly take some practice and patience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;These races usually also have
crates all over the place, which can make for a fun
additional target. Participation in races isn&amp;rsquo;t a
terribly great way to earn bolts, but at least the first few
times through a course there&amp;rsquo;s something to be
collected if you have built up the skill to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;There are two courses in the
game, one in Blackwater City on Rilgar, fairly early in the
game, and a required race on Kalebo later in the game. While
the Blackwater City race is strictly optional, I strongly
suggest everyone play it. Between the two courses, this is
the easier one, and the prize for first place, while not
strictly required, makes the later race MUCH easier.
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to understate this- while the prize you get
only matters in races, you&amp;rsquo;ll spend a similar amount
of time racing either way, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy it a lot more
if you win the first race.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;6. Conclusions
&lt;a name="6. Conclusions"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;In conversation I don&amp;rsquo;t
give people number scores for a game, I don&amp;rsquo;t think
that really gives a good impression of a game on its own.
However, I&amp;rsquo;m going to bury one way down at the bottom
here, to sort of give my overall impressions. I give Ratchet
and Clank a 56/64. It was a solid start to an even more
solid game, and despite my nitpicks with it, it&amp;rsquo;s not
a case where having played the later games the original is
no longer playable or enjoyable. The earliest games in the
series hold up almost as well as the later entries, and is
certainly worth playing if you can get your hands on a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;7. A Note on the Ratchet and Clank Collection
&lt;a name="7. A Note on the Ratchet and Clank Collection"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;If this is the way you find the
game, it&amp;rsquo;s still worth picking up. However, it runs
only at 720p, not 1080 like you might expect for a simpler
game running on PS3. Also, it does have a few more framerate
dips than the original. That said, the first game is fine
here, at any rate. I would advise getting the PS2 original
for any of the later games, however. At my best guess, the
engine from the first game was ported, and all of the newer
games run on that. This is fine to simply play the games,
but with my experience with the third game, even running on
an HDTV it looks far better on the PS2. There are various
blur and depth of field effects that sell some environments
(like underwater) where in the collection it looks like a
cheap PS2 game. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a case where that should
stop you from trying the game, again, but bear it in mind
when playing through.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Games"></category><category term="game"></category><category term="review"></category></entry><entry><title>Games!</title><link href="https://cannoncontraption.github.io/games.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-12-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Jim Read</name></author><id>tag:cannoncontraption.github.io,2020-12-18:/games.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;I Play Video Games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything
special these days, but I figure that at this point
I&amp;rsquo;ve probably played enough video games to have some
meaningful comments on them from time to time. This section

&lt;p style="margin-top: 1em"&gt;While not a terribly unique
position, I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing games most of my life,
starting on PC and on the original Nintendo (some of you
probably know it best as the NES). While these days all my
PC gaming is on Linux, I have four of the five Playstations,
an Xbox One X, a Nintendo, a Super Nintendo, and a FireCore
Genesis. This, in my opinion, gives me a wide base of gaming
experience to draw upon. As someone technical, I believe I
also have a basic understanding of how each of these
consoles work, as well as their strengths and
weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;
